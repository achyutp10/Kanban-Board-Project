A dynamic Kanban board application built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. Features drag-and-drop functionality, local storage persistence, and responsive design.

## Features

- Drag and drop task management
- Persistent storage using localStorage
- Responsive design with Tailwind CSS
- Smooth animations during card movements
- Task filtering and search capabilities
- Column management (add/delete columns)

## Technology Stack

- **React 18**: Modern UI library for building component-based interfaces
- **TypeScript**: Adds static typing for better development experience and fewer runtime errors
- **@hello-pangea/dnd**: Library for drag and drop functionality, chosen for its stability and React 18 compatibility
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development
- **LocalStorage**: Browser storage for data persistence

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone [repository-url]
cd kanban-board

npm install
npm start

## Known Limitations & Trade-offs

### 1. Data Management
- Local storage limitations (usually 5-10 MB)
- No data synchronization between devices
- Data can be lost if browser storage is cleared
- No backup functionality

### 2. Performance Considerations
- Large number of tasks (100+) may impact drag-drop performance
- All data is loaded into memory at once
- No data pagination or lazy loading

### 3. User Interface
- Limited responsive design for very small screens
- No touch optimization for mobile devices
- Basic animations might feel jerky on low-end devices
- Limited customization options for card appearance

### 4. Functionality
- No multi-user collaboration
- Cannot share boards or tasks
- No real-time updates
- No search functionality without advanced filters

### 5. Accessibility
- Limited keyboard navigation
- Basic screen reader support

### 6. Browser Compatibility
- Limited functionality in older browsers
- Mobile browser experience needs optimization
